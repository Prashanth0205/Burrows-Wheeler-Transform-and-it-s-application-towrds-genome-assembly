# Burrows Wheeler Transform and its application towards Genome Assembly

This project focuses on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), a pivotal algorithm in bioinformatics for sequence compression and pattern matching. By implementing BWT and its inverse, the project facilitates efficient compression of DNA sequences and enables precise pattern matching through FM index matrices. Researchers can harness these capabilities to explore genetic data comprehensively, from uncovering sequence structures to conducting intricate genomic analyses, thereby advancing understanding of biological systems and genetic phenomena.

This is implemented in 4 different languages: Julia, Java, R and JavaScript
